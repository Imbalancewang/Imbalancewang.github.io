    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Something about Markdown(I) Introduction Markdown is a light weight language, which has many merits. If you want to learn about more details, please click here.I will briefly introuduce the grammar of this language and my feel. I.About Markdown We can learn from the introduction that the Markdown is a light weight language. This language focuses on the simple grammar instead of the complex composing, which makes us concentrate on writting itself rather than optimizing the structure. What’s more, many editors and websites support this language, such as sublime ,jianshu and so on. Last but not least, when you finish the task with Markdown, the format of exportation could be varied. The official document of Markdown You can refer to more information with the below websites. http://markdown-here.com/ http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax http://wowubuntu.com/markdown/#list The merits of Markdown Focus on your content instead of composing. Easily export files with the format of HTML, PDF and md. Have a simple grammar and easy to learn. The tool of MarkdownI strongly suggest Mou and Macdown, if you are using the Mac. And also, MarkdownPad and MarkPad are very suuitable for Windows.]]></content>
